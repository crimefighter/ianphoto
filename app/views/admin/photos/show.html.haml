%p Drag and drop and then click Crop. Mind that real picture is 4 times bigger.

  %p This is uncropped version of an image. Existing cropped version will not change if you submit this page not moving cropping edges. Unless you check this:
  %p
    =f.check_box :reset_cropping
    =f.label :reset_cropping, "I want full image again"
  %p in which case cropping will be forced to occur and you will get your image back like nothing ever happened
  %h3 Choose the way this picture should be aligned when browser window is resized
  %div{:class => "alignment_preview #{@photo.alignment}"}

  %p Cropping requires a few seconds and may be finished after you are redirected back to category page. If you don't see thumbnail changed, refresh category page.
